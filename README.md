# Version 1.0: Rock, paper, scissors, SHOOT
- Just your average rock paper scissors you would play with your friend just that now you can play against the computer!
- And if you do not know what to chose you can type random and the computer choses one for you!

- This is my first real project assigned to me
- If there is anything I can improve on please let me know in the issues section of this repository

# Version 2.0: Essential features! (It is somewhat basic)
- I added a play again system so you can play again if you want
- If you want to examine the code I put comments seperating the different parts of the code. Ex.  #Inputing the computer input and user input into the game

# Version 3.0: PvP has been added!
- Now you can play against your friend if your want. But your choice will be hidden so that the other player can see what you chose!

# Coming Soon! (Version 3.1)
- I plan on trying to make the game look cleaner, and I plan on making it to where if player 1 wins then the game says congrats to player 1 and Well played to player 2. And vise versa. 

Hope you like it!
