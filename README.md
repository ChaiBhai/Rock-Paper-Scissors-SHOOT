# Rock, paper, scissors, SHOOT
- Just your average rock paper scissors you would play with your friend just that now you can play against the computer!
- And if you do not know what to chose you can type random and the computer choses one for you!

- This is my first real project assigned to me
- If there is anything I can improve on please let me know in the issues section of this repository


# Version 2.0: Awesome features! (It is somewhat basic)
- I added a play again system so you can play again if you want
- If you want to examine the code I put comments seperating the different parts of the code. Ex.  #Inputing the computer input and user input into the game

Hope you like it!
