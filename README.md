# Version 1.0: Rock, paper, scissors, SHOOT
- Just your average rock paper scissors you would play with your friend just that now you can play against the computer!
- And if you do not know what to chose you can type random and the computer choses one for you!

- This is my first real project assigned to me
- If there is anything I can improve on please let me know in the issues section of this repository

# Version 2.0: Essential features! (It is somewhat basic)
- I added a play again system so you can play again if you want
- If you want to examine the code I put comments seperating the different parts of the code. Ex.  #Inputing the computer input and user input into the game

# Version 3.0: PvP has been added!
- Now you can play against your friend if your want. But your choice will be hidden so that the other player can see what you chose!

# Version 3.1: Colors!
- I added colors to the game so it looks a little more appealing. Not much, but it is something!

# Coming Soon (Version 3.2)
- I am planning on adding music to the background of the game. I do not know if it will work but I have to check and see if it will work or not. 

Hope you like it!
